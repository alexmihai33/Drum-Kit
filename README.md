#This is a site that imitates a drum kit. You can play the different sounds available by clicking on the buttons that correspond to them or by pressing the keys that correspond to them (as shown on the interface)

This is done without jquery, as I wanted to get used to using EventListeners and QuerySelectors, so it is a very simple project.
